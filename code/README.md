# Skyscraper code base

Skyscraper allows for cheaper video ETL. This repository contains the prototype implementation used in the experiments.


## Structure
The code base has the following structure. Some file and directory names are different from the ones used in the paper. The names used in the paper are commented to the right.

## Experiments
We can only provide a subset of the data used in the experiments due to Google Drive's storage limit. Please download the data at the below links.

 - [COVID](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1unRQFc4Mh5cfVgIzEv3w6Hr0g5L52yMM?usp=sharing)
 - [MOT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1unRQFc4Mh5cfVgIzEv3w6Hr0g5L52yMM?usp=sharing)
 - [MOSEI](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/resources/cmu-mosei-dataset/)

The code for the three applications is in the respective workloads directories.

Currently, the code in the applications is written for an earlier API, where the user overrides a Workload class that has the tunable knobs as class member variables. This has no effects on the results.
